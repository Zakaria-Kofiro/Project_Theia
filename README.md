# Project_Theia

This is a desktop application that takes locks and unlocks a user's computer 
through facial recognition and detection. 

# Usage 
`python3 main.py`

## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes mostly from our interest in computer vision, as well as secruity. We looked at how laptop secruity is today, and thought about how it could be changed and innovated for the better. While there are products out there that offer facial detection and recognizition based security, they usually come deeply imbedded with a given operating system, or are pricy. Thus, we offer this free alternative to step into the world of computer vision!  

## What it does
This project automatically locks your computer once your face leaves the camera area. After an intially set-up, the program is trained to recognize and follow your face, thus provoiding you with extra security when you aren't around your laptop. Also, if anyone happens to try to access your computer when you are not there, we also have extra features to prevent them, such as sleeping the screen or out right logging them out. 

## How we built it
We built ground up using the OpenCV library in Python, and also build a Graphical User Interface to log in and out of the desktop application using more Python and PYQT5. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges while developing this, everything from getting the camera to work right and recognize even a face, to making sure pesky intruders could not simply click out of the security measures put in place. Though this project was very challenging, it was also fun and rewarding. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of producing one of our first few projects using Computer Vision technologies, and getting a lot of experience problem solving and working as a team. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot about working with face recognition and detection, tracking running processes, scripting, git version control, command line programming, and lot about building up GUIs and applications in general. 

## What's next for Project_Theia
We plan to build this project out by incoperating lower level system programming to actually allow the user to fully log out and into their computer.
